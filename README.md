### Python Mini Project

Although I can code in other languages, I am new to Python. This repo contains projects developed as I extend my Python coding skills.

* Most are sourced from those listed in https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects
* Have also included additional projects from other sources
* Each project increases in level of difficulty (see the main listing for further details)

#### 99 Bottles
A program that uses a built in function to print out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." 

**What I learned:**
1. Defining functions in Python
2. If statements and coonditional tests
3. Print statements 
4. Working with strings

#### Armstrong Number
An Armstrong Number is any number of n digits which is equal to the sum of nth power of digits in the number. 
For example: 92727 = 9^5 + 2^5 + 7^5 + 2^5 + 7^5 (where n = 5)
A program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong Number. Users may enter multiple tests.

**What I learned:**
1. input() function
2. User prompts
3. While loops
4. Using flags

#### Magic 8 Ball
Simulation of a magic 8-ball. Allow the user to enter their question and display an in progress message.
Create 20 responses, and show a random response. Allow the user to ask another question or quit.
Program includes a GUI where users can enter the following questions:
* ask
* clear (the text box)
* play again
* quit (this must close the window)

**What I learned:**
1. Importing modules
2. Working with classes
3. Creating a GUI with Ktinker
4. Lists and arrays

#### Pythagorean Triples Checker
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a² + b² = c².
Allows the user to input the sides of any triangle in any order and returns whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
Users may reuse the program without having to quit.

**What I learned:**
1. More functions
2. Variables
3. Nested for loops vs list comprehensions
